    <h2>Welcome to Reading Copilot</h2>
    <p><strong>Reading Copilot</strong> combines the timeless charm of literature with the innovative application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enrich your reading experience. This platform ensures interactive, contextually relevant discussions with books, all without spoiling the adventure of discovery.</p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Reading Copilot integrates advanced RAG methodology to deliver a seamless reading experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contextual Information Retrieval</strong>: As you read, our system dynamically retrieves information from the specific book you are engaged with, using your current page as a boundary to avoid spoilers. This retrieval is tailored to each query, ensuring relevance and accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Response Generation</strong>: Leveraging dual language models, Reading Copilot generates responses by fusing retrieved information with the context of your query. This process ensures that every interaction is informative, engaging, and uniquely suited to your current reading material and progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Technology Behind the Scenes</h3>
    <p>At the core of Reading Copilot are powerful NLP tools and a robust vector database:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NLP Service</strong>: Utilizes sophisticated models for text segmentation and embedding, ensuring efficient and relevant data retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Milvus Vector Database</strong>: Manages the storage and retrieval of text embeddings, facilitating rapid and precise query handling.</li>
    </ul>
